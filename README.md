The Rules:

1. All tiles have the same aspect ratio of 4:3
2. The aspect ratio must be preserved
3. The minimum width is 250px (min height 188px)
4. There is no space between the tiles
5. No partially displayed tiles are allowed
6. There cannot be more than 12 or fewer than 2 tiles displayed at any time
7. Provide a mechanism to change the number of tiles
8. Support screen resizing (explicitly???)
9. Demo code and provide repo (no deploy, one would guess...)


The Objective: 

1. Optimize the size and number of tiles to be displayed at any given time on any given screen

Assumptions:

1. "Optimized" means...what exactly?# SousLesPaves
